# Relaxer


Creating a Relaxer web application was an exciting and challenging task that allowed me to explore the world of web development. I started by brainstorming ideas for the application and finally settled on a Relaxer app that would help people destress and unwind after a long day. As a web developer, I knew that using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be the perfect combination to create a user-friendly and visually appealing application.
